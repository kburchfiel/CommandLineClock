## Important:

In order to get the program to work:

1. Download and unzip the entire repository. (Click on the green "Code" button and then select "Download ZIP." Unzip the folder once it has downloaded.)

2. **Cut and paste the tzdata folder from the repository folder into your C:\Users\[username]\Downloads folder (where [username] is your actual username).** The tzdata folder contains time zone information that the program will need in order to run. The path of the tzdata folder should look like **C:\Users\[username]\Downloads\tzdata**.

3. To run the program, go back into the repository folder, open the Release folder, and then double-click on CWClock.exe (whose type is displayed as "Application."

4. You will likely need to give the program permission to run when launching it for the first time. If you get a message saying "Windows protected your PC," click on "More info" and then select "Run anyway" near the bottom.


## About:

ConsoleWorldClock is a minimalist program that shows the current time in 26 different cities around the world. It is meant to display lots of information within a relatively small footprint.

The console window can be narrowed in order to display times within an even smaller frame:
